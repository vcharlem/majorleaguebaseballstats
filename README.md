## MLB Responsive Statistics & Search Feature
- Response: [Discription](https://gist.github.com/wnoronha/9bc99ba2bc421c9599c72c9960c28333)
- DataSet: [1998 MLBStats](http://www.cafeconleche.org/examples/baseball/1998statistics.xml)

### Below are urls for github of the code and the app which is now running on Heroku.
1.	https://github.com/vcharlem/majorleaguebaseballstats
2.	http://majorleaguestats.herokuapp.com/

### Just a couple of notes regarding this projectâ€¦
1. It is currently running Rails 4.2/Ruby 22
2. We're taking advantage of popular gems like Bootstrap, Nokogiri and Will_pagination. 
3. Calculations and terms were based on [Wiki-Baseball Stats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_statistics)
4. It adds a Search Box which searches by last name of players

### Future plan is to add
1. multiple views of the available baseball stats.
2. additional functionality and notes so that this repository can become a learning aid to others.
